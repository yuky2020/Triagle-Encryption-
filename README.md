# Triagle Encryption 
The triangle Encryption is a method for encode a text and have a Higher hamming distance from the original one.
## Why
is useful to improve sec using a crypto scheme, is not intended to be a OWF there is in fact  both a DEC and an ENC function, but since hamming distance is bigger it will be useful as a preloude to encryption
